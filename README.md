# Tasks - Crud com qualidade // Dev Soutinho
This repository is part of a study series based on JS that will help me to understand more deeply the back-end development

### Workflow
This repository use the folowing commit structure:

• main = Branch with the stable release of the application
• develop = Branch that will store new stable features and changes
• release = Branch that will hold the Develop changes and apply at Main
• hotfix = Branch type used to solve important and fast errors, when solved is merged to develop and main
• feat/<feature_name> = Branch used to determine that a new feature is being - or already was - done 
• refac/<feature_name> = Branch used to determine that a refactoring is being - or already was - done 

The commit should be short and cut to the chase
